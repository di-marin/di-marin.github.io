## Hello

I'm Diana Marin, and I’m currently working as postdoctoral researcher at TU Wien. I focused on proximity-based point cloud reconstruction (curves and surfaces) during my PhD at TU Wien. I am currently investigating how we reconstruct, interpret, and interact with unstructured data by combining geometry, topology and human perception, with application to various fields (clustering, segmentation, procedural generation).


## Projects

- [**RE:STOCK INDUSTRY**](https://www.vr.tuwien.ac.at/projects/restock-industry/) We are developing tools that enable the analysis of industrial buildings for possible vertical reuse. I am working on the extraction of structural elements from 3D scans to enable finite element analysis.
- [**PostDisaster**](https://www.vr.tuwien.ac.at/projects/postdisaster/) We are working with experts to create tools that can help them in efficiently analyze and plan after disastrous events (floods, earthquakes). I am developing an image-based large scale fast reconstruction method.
- [**Modeling the World at Scale**](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/WorldScale) I developed methods to improve point cloud reconstruction through improved proximity definitions applied to various settings.
