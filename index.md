## Hello

Iâ€™m currently working as postdoctoral researcher in the Virtual and Augmented Reality Group at TU Wien. I defended my PhD in February 2025 as part of the Rendering and Modeling Group at TU Wien, under Prof. Michael Wimmer's and Dr. Stefan Ohrhallinger's supervision, titled *Proximity-Based Point Cloud Reconstruction*. I am currently investigating how we reconstruct, interpret, and interact with unstructured data by combining geometry, topology and human perception, with application to various fields such as clustering, segmentation and procedural generation.


## Projects

- [PostDisaster](https://www.vr.tuwien.ac.at/projects/postdisaster/): 2025 - Present
<p class="indented">
  We are working with experts to create tools that can help them in efficiently analyze and plan after disastrous events (floods, earthquakes). I am developing an image-based large scale fast reconstruction method.
</p>
- [RE:STOCK INDUSTRY](https://www.vr.tuwien.ac.at/projects/restock-industry/): 2024 - Present
<p class="indented">
  We are developing tools that enable the analysis of industrial buildings for possible vertical reuse. I am working on the extraction of structural elements from 3D scans to enable finite element analysis.
</p>
- [Modeling the World at Scale](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/WorldScale): 2021-2024
<p class="indented">
I developed methods to improve point cloud reconstruction through improved proximity definitions applied to various settings.

## Teaching
- **Programming Techniques for Visual Computing** @ TU Wien, 2022-2025. 
<p class="indented">
I guide students to develop a game from scratch in OpenGL or Vulkan, gaining experience in hands-on implementation of visual effects. You can check out some of my students' games 
<a href="https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/PTVC/HallOfFame">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/CG/HallOfFame">here</a>.
</p>
- **Computer Graphics** @ University of Leeds, 2020 - Teaching Assistant.
<p class="indented">
I assisted students with personal tutorials to help them better understand graphics concepts,  and I marked part of the coursework.
